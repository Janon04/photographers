## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected with CSRF tokens

### Models Created
1. **AdminActivityLog**: Tracks all admin activities
2. **PlatformSettings**: Store platform-wide configuration
3. **SystemNotification**: Manage system notifications
4. **PlatformAnalytics**: Daily analytics snapshots

### URL Structure

## Admin User Creation

An admin user has been created with the following credentials:

- **Password**: admin123
- **Role**: Platform Admin
- **Status**: Active and Verified

## Usage Instructions

2. **Review Moderation**: Approve user reviews before public display
3. **Platform Monitoring**: Monitor platform usage through analytics
4. **System Announcements**: Create notifications for users
5. **Security Auditing**: Review admin activity logs

### Export Functionality

- Access via "Export CSV" buttons in each management section

## Navigation Integration
